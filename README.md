# PNP-CAM  

This repository contains the fully open-source design for a bottom camera assembly, specifically designed for a pick-and-place machine. The assembly features a **compact plastic enclosure**, available on AliExpress, that houses a **camera module** mounted on a custom circuit board integrated into the lid.  

The custom circuit board includes **strategically placed LEDs** and a **terminal on the bottom**, ensuring optimal illumination and precise visual quality from the camera. The camera is securely mounted inside the enclosure, extending through an opening to maintain a precise and reliable fit.  

As a core component of the pick-and-place system, this assembly plays a critical role in ensuring the machine's accuracy and performance.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)  
The following components are required for the assembly. Please note that you may need to source parts from your preferred suppliers:

1. **Camera module**: Ensure the camera module matches the exact specification used in this design. (The one in the picture may differ slightly from the unit I received; confirm with the seller.)
2. **16 × LEDs**: 0805 package. The exact type should be selected based on your lighting requirements.
3. **16 × Resistors**: 0805 package. The resistor values depend on the specific LEDs chosen.
4. **1 × 5.08 mm screw terminal**: For providing connectivity.
5. **4 × M3 bolts**: These bolts are required to attach the camera assembly to the enclosure. The provided bolts are countersunk, though **panhead bolts** are preferred.
6. **4 × M3 bolts**: These are required to attach the camera to the assembly.
7. **12 × M3 nuts**: For securing the camera to the assembly.
8. **Bottom camera light PCB**: Custom-designed PCB for the bottom illumination.

More specific details regarding the exact components and their sourcing will be available once I have fully tested and updated this assembly. I will be happy to provide more information before it is added to this repository if anyone requests it. However, I personally prefer to test everything first, as it will simplify the process rather than making changes repeatedly.

## Notes  
- The **board files** are available for ordering the custom PCB. However, please wait until I have tested the design before placing an order.  
- Links to components and additional BOM details may be added in the future, but please note this is a work in progress.
